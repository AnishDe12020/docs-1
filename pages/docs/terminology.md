# Terminology

## Metaplex

Metaplex enables artists and creators to launch self-hosted NFT storefronts as easily as building a website. Ultra-fast NFTs with insanely low minting fees.

Metaplex is a Solana-powered protocol that allows for the creation and minting of non-fungible tokens, auctions, and visualizing NFTs in a standard way across wallets and applications, comprised of two core components: an on-chain program, and a self-hosted front-end web2 application.
